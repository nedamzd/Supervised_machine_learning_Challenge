# Supervised_machine_learning_Challenge

The objective is to build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not. 

## Problem Description

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

 this data was used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier were compared.
